Create Class for each generator type
	-update(dt)
	-calculatePixel(index)

For Particle
	Iterate over each particle and manipulate only the pixels within a certain range of influence
	Allows for performance compromise with high particle simulations
	Each pixel will keep a reference of the 4 closest particles
	Bilinear interpolation can be used 

---ISSUES--- 
	- Particle wrapping may still be poor due to fmod being dumb

---TODO---
	- Implement more particle features
		o fade in - fade out intensity
		o proper color calculation
